# VS 
Simulation of four Clustering Algorithms for VANET: APROVE, VWCA, MOZO and FitnessClustering using VANETSim simulator. 

VANETsim: A simulator for security and privacy concepts in VANETs. In this project, we use only the scenario generated by VANETSim. We have added an extension to this simulator, in hope to get Vehicle arrival time during a specific time of simulation. The number of vehicles to be injected in the map is variable according to the generated Poisson distribution.  

VANET-Simulator has an interface to import maps from the OpenStreetMap project. So the simulation of traffic on real road networks is supported.

-- You will find the current version in the "VS"-branch! --

For VANETSim development (the "develop" branch). For ready to use packages of --> http://www.vanet-simulator.org. This version is used and extended in VS project. 

The source code structure supports easy adaptation and extension of features. The VS project is developed in Java to evaluate Clustering in Vanet for APROVE, VWCA, MoZO and FitnessClustering. The scenario of simulation can be generated or loaded via VanetSim. Lambda parameter is used to get different density of traffic during the time of simulation TSim.
